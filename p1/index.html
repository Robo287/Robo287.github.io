        <p>Let's start with a big one first, Nergigante. Affectionately named <span id="NergiBoi">Nergi Boi</span> by my group of friends<br>I hunt with, his quick lashing attacks, devistating divebombs and near impenetrable spikes will cause trouble<br>for even seasoned hunter.</p>
        <h3>The Fight</h3>
        <p>Nergigante is fast and ruthless, usually favoring long lunging attacked and big dive bombs to overwhelm you.<br>Always keep an eye on who he's focusing on because he may suprise an unattentive hunter with one of his<br>long distance dive bombs. Along with his devestating power is Nergigante's spikes that he grows on his body.<br>The will start white and slowly grow from his arms and wings and after enough time they will become black<br>and impenetrable to your weapons</p>
        <h3>The Strategy</h3>
        <p>While Nergigante is formibale, he's not unbeatable, here's a few tips to help in the fight:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Have one of your hunters act as support, keeping an eye on everyones health and applying buffs when needed</li>
            <li>Attack his spikes, they're weak points and do extra damage, also if you damage them enough, they will break<br>and has to start the growing process again</li>
            <li>When he flies up high, get ready to dodge or defend, any weapon with a heavy shield and the proper buffs can<br>survive his dive bombs, but your best bet is to run</li>
            <li>Keep your hunters spread out, focuse on different parts of his body to weaken him more effectively, also you<br>don't want to be close together when he does his dive bombs, multiple hunters going down will end<br>your hunt very quickly</li>
        </ul>

            <h2>Kirin</h2>
            <img src="p1Files/img/Kirin.jpg" alt="Lightning Pony" />
        </div>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Name</th>
                <td>Kirin</td>

        <p>Next up is another Elder Dragon by the name of Kirin, or as I like to call it, <span id="Pony">Lightning Pony.</span> This monster<br>will utilize the incredible power of lightning to dissorient it foes and keep them away. Kirin is also very<br>mobile, making it very difficult for hunters to keep up with it.</p>
        <h3>The Fight</h3>
        <p>Kirin will do her best to keep away from the hunters, often favoring wide area attacks and jumping around to avoid<br>being hit by hunters. In the Coral Highlands where you fight her, she'll use the multiple levels present on the stage to<br>her advantage to quickly bound away from the fight. What would take the hunter minutes to scale, she can jump in a<br>few moments. When she does unleash her lightning, it'll be a storm of random strikes around her, spread out area<br>blasts and a focuses beam that'll roast any hunter caught in it.</p>
        <h3>The Strategy</h3>
        <p>Kirin may be fast, but a quickwitted hunter can be faster with these tips:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Kirin isn't the only one that can use the enviroment to her advantage, your clutch claw can latch on to the glowing<br>insects hanging near the cliffs to help you scale the Coral Highlands as fast as Kirin</li>
            <li>Don't bother with trying to use traps, as an Elder Dragon, these creatures are unaffected by pitfall or shock traps</li>
            <li>Use status effects to your advantage such as sleep to get Kirin to fall asleep so you can set up a charge hit or bombs<br>for massive damage, also poison can help inflict some slow damage over time, but any little bit helps</li>
            <li>If you can corner Kirin, stay spread out, her lightning attacks can stun you and another hunter can help you recover<br>faster should you be stunned, also her focused blast attack is very deadly and staying spread<br>out will increase your team's survivablity</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please enjoy another video by Arekkz showing how deadly a High Rank Kirin can be:</p>

            <h2>Deviljho</h2>
            <img src="p1Files/img/Deviljho.jpg" alt="The Pickle" />
        </div>
        <br>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Name</th>
                <td>Deviljho</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>Species</th>

        </table>
        <p>Lastly we have the world eater, Deviljho otherwise know as <span id="Pickle">The Pickle</span> this beast is an alpha amongst monster. It can<br>survive anywhere and it's diet consists of other monsters, but it's not uncommon for this brute to snack on a hunter or<br>two should they get in its way</p>
        <h3>The Fight</h3>
        <p>Deviljho is a force to be reckoned with. Don't be fooled by its size, this creature is fast and will take you down before you know<br>it. Its breath attack is slow, but wide and if hit by it will induce the dragonblight and defense down ailments on unwarry hunters.<br>Dragonblight will nullify any elemental advantage you're trying to leverage on Deviljho until it subsides. Deviljho also does wide<br>area sweep attacks with its tail and wide chomps with its huge mouth, both of which are fast and unpredictable.</p>
        <h3>The Strategy</h3>
        <p>Deviljho may be intimidating, but these tips can help hunters chop this pickle:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Since Deviljho is a regular Brute Wyvern, traps are effective against him, plan where you place them and try to lead him into<br>pitfalls and shocks to help give you some good hits into him</li>
            <li>Be aware of his Dragonblight breath, even while he's trapped he can still use it, try to stay near his back with more mobile<br>hunters braving his face</li>
            <li>Use Dragon element weapons against him, they're hard to get, but they pack a ton of raw damage and the extra Dragon element<br>damage is a welcome aid in your fight</li>
            <li>Work on his tail, if you can severe his tail, that's one less thing to worry about when fighting him and can really turn the tide</li>
        </ul>
