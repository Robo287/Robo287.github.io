                <p class="lead">As we've discussed in the previous article <a href="https://lamp.cse.fau.edu/~arobustelli2018/p1">here</a>, there are many terrible creatures in Monster Hunter: World that want you dead. As a hunter of the Research Commission your job is to observe the endemic life of the New World, but these creatures sometimes don't like to be observed and will lash out. Luckily you're equipped with gear to help you deal with such threats and here's one of my favorites.</p>
                <div class="d-flex">
                    <div class="px-4"><h4>Longsword</h4></div>
                    <hr class="my-auto flex-grow-1 weapontitle">
                </div>
                <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e86lHq-03H4"></iframe>
                <p>For anyone who's in love with the idea of being a badass samurai that has mastered the art of destroying any enemy before them. I'm talking of the longsword. Fast, fluid and razor sharp, this blade excels at tons of damage, flashy moves slicing off valuable monster parts.</p>
                <p>What the longsword lacks in raw power and durability it makes up for with speed and versatility. As a longsword user you can quickly roll and dodge with your weapon drawn and your attacks are meant to be quick and precise until you see and opening in which you can swoop in with a big combo doing major damage and then getting out before the monster even knows what to do</p>
                <h6>The Mechanics</h6>
                <p>When fighting with the longsword, there are three resources you must keep an eye on: Stamina, Spirit Gauge and Sharpness.</p>
                <p>First is your stamina which is required for rolling out of the way of big damaging attacks, try and spec your gear to help you buff your stamina amount and/or recovery, not being able to roll and, even worse, being fatigued can quickly end your hunt prematurely.</p>
                <p>Next to worry about is your Spirit Gauge. This Gauge is filled by repeatedly hitting the monster with your small attacks and combos using the <img src="p2images/triangle.png" alt="ps4triangle"> and <img src="p2images/circle.png" alt="ps4circle"> buttons. Once the meter is filled you can unleash a flurry of Spirit Slashes using combos of the <img src="p2images/r2.png" alt="ps4r2"> button. If you can successfully complete a Spirit Slash combo and hit the monster with the last slash, your Spirit Gauge will glow white. This indicates you have access to a Helmbreaker Slash which can be activate by facing the monster and pressing <img src="p2images/r2.png" alt="ps4r2"> + <img src="p2images/triangle.png" alt="ps4triangle">. Your hunter will rush the monster with a stab, then run up its side and leap into the air after which you bring down glorious bladed justice unto your foe and massive damage.</p>
                <p>Finally is your weapon sharpness. As you pound on the monster over and over your weapon will gradually become more dull. The begining sparness value of your weapon is dependant on how rare your weapon is, also your base weapon sharpness can be improved with armor buffs. Once your sharpness decreases enough, you won't even be able to damage the monster, find a break moment in the fight, usually when the monster runs away for a bit or if it's focused on your friends, and pull out your whetstone to do a quick sharpen. A few short scrapes and your weapon will be topped up at full sharpness adn you can get back into the fight.</p>
                <h6>The Moves</h6>
                <p>Keeping your resources in check will make you a better hunter for it, but mastering your combos are what will make you deadly, below are some of my favorite combos to work into my hunts:</p>
                <div class="card">
                    <h6 class="card-header">Basic Attack Combo - Quickly Build Spirit Meter</h6>
                    <div class="card-body"><strong>INPUT: </strong><img src="p2images/circle.png" alt="ps4circle"> > <img src="p2images/triangle.png" alt="ps4triangle"> (cycle repeatedly)</div>
                </div>
                <p>First is the basic attack combo, unsheathing your weapon and then pressing <img src="p2images/circle.png" alt="ps4circle"> followed by <img src="p2images/triangle.png" alt="ps4triangle"> will perform a quick stab and an upward slash and this can be repeated indefinitely. The combo is quick and you can easily work in an evade roll to get out of the way quickly, also each hit will fill your Spirit Meter so a quick combo is ideal.</p>
                <div class="card">
                    <h6 class="card-header">Sheathe Attack Combo - Quickly Build Spirit Meter</h6>
                    <div class="card-body"><strong>INPUT: </strong><img src="p2images/r2.png" alt="ps4r2"> + <img src="p2images/cross.png" alt="ps4cross"> > <img src="p2images/triangle.png" alt="ps4triangle"></div>
                </div>
                <p>Next is one of my favorite moves that make you feel like a badass samurai warrior. Pressing the <img src="p2images/r2.png" alt="ps4r2"> and <img src="p2images/cross.png" alt="ps4cross"> buttons together will put you in a state called Special Sheathe. Your hunter sheathe will their blade and hold it at their side in a ready stance for a short while. In this state you cannot move, only wait. If you press the <img src="p2images/triangle.png" alt="ps4triangle"> button while in this state, you will perform two quick slashes in a cross pattern. If these hit the monster, your Spirit Gauge will automatically fill itself for a short time. If you time the slash perfectly just as the monster is about to strike you, you will dodge through its attack and the Spirit Gauge will autofill for an even longer period of time. Truly this technique favors the bold.</p>
                <div class="card">
                    <h6 class="card-header">Spirit Slash Combo - Build Your Spirit Gauge Level</h6>
                    <div class="card-body"><strong>INPUT: </strong><img src="p2images/r2.png" alt="ps4r2"> > <img src="p2images/r2.png" alt="ps4r2"> > <img src="p2images/r2.png" alt="ps4r2"> > <img src="p2images/r2.png" alt="ps4r2"></div>
                </div>
                <p>Next what do we do when our Spirit Gauge is full? We use it by performing the Spirit Slash combo. Pressing the <img src="p2images/r2.png" alt="ps4r2"> button in rythmic succession four times will have you complete the combo. If the last slash of the combo hits the monster, your Spirit Gauge will highlight in white indicating you have access to one Spirit Helmbreaker or Special Sheathe Spirit Slash, but if you instead fill up your Spirit Gauge again and perform another Spirit Slash combo, your Gauge will turn from white to yellow. Repeating this a third time will see it go red which is the max number of times you can fill your Spirit Gauge levels. Red Gauge means you now have three Spirit Helmbreakers at your disposal, each getting progressively weaker as the Spirit Gauge level gets consumed by each finisher.</p>
                <div class="card">
                    <h6 class="card-header">Special Sheathe Spirit Slash - Big Damage and Bigger Rewards for the Brave</h6>
                    <div class="card-body"><strong>INPUT: </strong><img src="p2images/r2.png" alt="ps4r2"> + <img src="p2images/cross.png" alt="ps4cross"> > <img src="p2images/r2.png" alt="ps4r2"></div>
                </div>
                <p>Now we're going to dip into the damage dealers, these can old truly be performed when you've earned one level on your Spirit Gauge. First is a Special Sheathe combo. Going into Special Sheate and then pressing <img src="p2images/r2.png" alt="ps4r2"> will have you perform wide slash that will do tons of damage. Just like with the other Special Sheathe combo, if you time it just right, you'll get a bonus. This time the bonus is your Spirit Gauge level will not be consumed with the slash.</p>
                <div class="card">
                    <h6 class="card-header">Spirit Helmbreaker - Massive Damage and Flashy Moves</h6>
                    <div class="card-body"><strong>INPUT: </strong><img src="p2images/r2.png" alt="ps4r2"> + <img src="p2images/triangle.png" alt="ps4triangle"> (successfully hit the monster and jump) > <img src="p2images/triangle.png" alt="ps4triangle"></div>
                </div>
                <p>Finally, we have the money-maker. This attack is your most powerful move in your arsenal. Facing the monster and pressing <img src="p2images/r2.png" alt="ps4r2"> + <img src="p2images/triangle.png" alt="ps4triangle"> together will have you run and stab at the monster, if you hit it, you jump into the air to prepare you final slash. If you turn the camera and press the <img src="p2images/triangle.png" alt="ps4triangle"> button, you perform the overhead slash in that direction so if the monster moves after you've jumped in the air quickly rotate the camera so the center of the screen has the part of the monster you want to hit and press the <img src="p2images/triangle.png" alt="ps4triangle"> button to finish off your attack. As stated before, this attack benefits from what level of Spirit Gauge you have to be sure to max it out to red level to get the most bang for your buck</p>
                <h6>Conclusion</h6>
                <p>Mastering the longsword takes practice. While you may be quick, you still have to wary of your surroundings. Study your prey carefully, learn its moves, figure out when the best time to strike is. The longsword favors the patient and wise. Trying to rush in without a plan will almost always result in failure. Use the environment to your advantage or bring a friend along to help take some of the heat off you when hunting the monster. If you can master some of these combos, you'll become an excellent hunter and a force to be reckonned with. Happy hunting.</p>
